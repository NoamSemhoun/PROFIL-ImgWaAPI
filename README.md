# PROFIL-ImgWaAPI
Whatsapp or "ME" API 

-> Develop a tool that can automatically retrieve profile pictures of WhatsApp users based on their phone numbers. The tool will be implemented using VBA code in Microsoft Excel, and it will use Internet Explorer to navigate to the WhatsApp web client and extract the profile picture URL for each phone number in a given Excel sheet. The extracted URLs will be used to display the corresponding profile pictures in the same Excel sheet.

This tool can be useful for businesses or individuals who need to quickly retrieve profile pictures of multiple WhatsApp users for various purposes, such as customer relationship management or research.
